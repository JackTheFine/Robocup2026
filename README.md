Hardware:

The body of each of our robots was made from three layers of laser-cut ⅛″ wood connected by a bunch of 5 or 6 mm hex standoffs. 
1. The bottom layer for both robots are disks with cutouts for four omniwheels and four “line detectors” (discussed later) and some holes for the standoffs.
2. The middle layer is a circular ring meant for holding the 16 IR sensors. For each equally spaced sensor there are three holes for the three sensor pins and holes for the standoffs.
3. The top layer is a disk with, a small hole in the centre for wires, somes holes for zip ties to connect the battery to the top, and again some holes for the standoffs.
